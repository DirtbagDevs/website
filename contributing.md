Introduction
Welcome to the DirtbagDevs website project repository!
First off, thank you for considering contributing to DirtbagDevs. Together, we hope that we can make a website to be proud of.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Keep an open mind when it comes to contributing. Improving documentation, bug searching are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

Responsibilities:
Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/4feef90445b9680475f2
Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.

Code review process:
Once you have commited your code to your working branch. The code must be reviewed and approved by at least 2 members of the time.
If the code passes approval, your branch will then be merged into the master branch.

Community:
Any questions or discussions required, we are always availble via the DirtbagDev Slack channel.

Code, commit message and labeling conventions:
There are 3 branch types that should be used when naming your branches. 
Hotfix,
Feature, 
Bugfix.

This is then followed with a clear name of the intention of work to be performed within the branch. 

eg. BugFix/fix_scrolling_for_index

When starting a new branch, always pull from the develop/master branch before you start to code anything.

Preferred coding principles:
DRY: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself

Thank you for reading the contributions.md. Look forward to working together!
